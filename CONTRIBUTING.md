# Contributing Guidelines

Use of generative AI tools is generally not permitted unless explicitly approved by the project lead, and cited properly. Please follow the directory stucture outlined below when contributing new models or experiments.

When submitting code, please make sure you use a linter to clean it up and follow the existing coding style. All configs and path should be relative to the repository root.

## Repository Structure

- **Models/**: Each researcher’s implementation
  - `Multi/` and `Single/` for multi-class and single-class segmentation
- **Utility/**: Shared scripts, configs, and pipelines
- **Reports/**: Experiment summaries and figures
- **Notebooks/**: Data exploration or visualization work

Please follow this structure when adding new experiments.
