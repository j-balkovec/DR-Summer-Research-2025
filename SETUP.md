# Setup Guide

Clone or fork the repository to your local machine, then use the appropriate tools to get started.

If you're using **Google Colab**, you should be set (**Hybrid** and **Image** models).
For local setups, ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

If you're working on the **Image model**, please consult the **TAMU ACCESS setup guide** for GPU and `env` configurations.
There is a document in the repo about this.
